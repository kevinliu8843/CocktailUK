      <P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Brandy is a warm spirit
      distilled from wine and is produced in many forms from around the world.
      The best known are the Cognacs and Armagnacs of France. However, good
      brandy is also produced by many other countries around the world.
      <P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Top-quality brandies are
      produced in copper pot stills. The tradition of maturing brandy goes back
      to the 15<SUP>th </SUP>century, when an alchemist allegedly took his
      precious barrel of aqua vitae and buried it in his yard to protect it
      against the guards and soldiers. The barrel was found years later but half
      of the liquor had evaporated leaving a rich smooth nectar.
      <P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Brandy is an extremely
      versatile drink that mixes well with a wide range of other flavours, as the
      following recipes demonstrates.</TD>
