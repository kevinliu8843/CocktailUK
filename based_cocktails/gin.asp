      <P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Gin is a very common used
      base for cocktails, including the famous martini. The original gin was
      concocted illegally in bathtubs and bore little resemblance to the gin
      we know today. It was probably this poor flavour that gave cocktails their
      popularity.
      <P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Gin is a &quot;neutral,
      rectified spirit distilled from any grain, potato or beet and flavoured
      with juniper&quot;. Clearly with this definition there are alot of
      variations of &quot;gin&quot; around. And each manufacturer keeps their
      recipe closely guarded.</TD>
