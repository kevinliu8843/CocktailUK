      <P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Rum is a rich and fragrant
      spirit, distilled from molasses in a pot still or a patent still. The drink
      is associated with the tropics because most sugar cane is grown there
      (this is where molasses come from). Rum is clear when is comes from the
      still (white rum), but is also matured in oak casks to give it a caramel colour
      (dark rum).<P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Drinkers
      have discovered that the rich taste combines perfectly with fruit
      juice to give a tropical flavour to cocktails.<P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">There
      are hundreds of rum-based cocktails available to mixologists, however
      here are a select few.</TD>
