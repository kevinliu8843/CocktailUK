      <P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">The word &quot;vodka&quot;
      comes from the Russian &quot;Zhiznennia voda&quot;, which means &quot;water
      of life&quot;. &quot;Vodka&quot; means &quot;little water&quot;.<P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Vodka
      can be distilled from any number of sources including potatoes and sugar
      cane. The spirit is then filtered through charcoal to filter out
      impurities, and the resultant liquor is then the perfect base for a
      cocktail. It adds the kick of alcohol but without the taste. This is one
      of the great things about vodka: it is almost odourless. So it cannot be
      detected on your breath.<P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Vodka
      is the ideal drink for beginners to use in experiments.</TD>
