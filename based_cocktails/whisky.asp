      depending on its origin) is made in many parts of the world. Whisky
      (without the &quot;e&quot;) is produced in Scotland. This is usually
      referred to as Scotch. All other whiskies are spelled with an
      &quot;e&quot; to distinguish them from the real thing.<P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Essentially
      whisky is distilled from fermented mash made of malted grain. In Scotland
      it derives much of its rich flavour from peat.<P style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">Some
      of the best known are single malts, which are produced from a particular
      distillery. While most commercial ones are blended, made from products of several regions.</TD>
