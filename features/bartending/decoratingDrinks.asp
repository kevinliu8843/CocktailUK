    The difference between a good and an excellent drink is not just how
    it is mixed, but also how it looks and smells. The conscientious bartender
    should take care to ensure that the cocktail is stimulating visually as well
    as to the palette.
    <P><I>There is however a temptation for overkill - fruit, plastic
    umbrellas, swizzle sticks etc... Such a concoction would simply look a mess.</I></P>
    <P>No, by adding just the correct amount of garnish, the wise
    bartender achieves the perfect balance, whilst giving a visual indication of
    what is to be expected in terms of flavour.&nbsp;<BR>
    For example, a slice of lemon or lime indicates a sharp, crisp
    cocktail is awaiting, whilst a maraschino cherry or ball of melon indicates
    a sweet cocktail.</P>
    <P>Clearly there are some cocktails that have a traditional
    garnish added to them (the olive in a <A href="/db/viewCocktail.asp?ID=1">dry
    martini</A>). In some cases (such as a margarita) the glass rim is frosted
    with salt. This is best done by first wetting the rim.</P>
    <H3>Fruit</H3>
    <P>Fruit plays a vital role in cocktail making. Most cocktails
    require some fruit in them, and it is a useful thing to keep a fair
    amount of fresh fruit available for parties and other occasions.</P>
    <P>Fruit is important for adding eye appeal, but can also (in
    moderation) be an exciting base for cocktails. Hopefully some of these
    photographs will provide inspiration for you.
