    For those who wish to take their cocktail making a little more seriously
    than the one-party stand, some proper equipment is worth getting.
    <P>When selecting equipment, try to buy good quality items that feel good
    and do the job for which they are intended.</P>
    <P>Here is a short list of items that the home bartender would need.</P>
    <HR noshade color="#612B83" size="1">
    <P><B>A sharp knife</B></P>
    <P><B>An ice bucket</B> : The traditional ice bucket is made of metal but
    sometimes one with insulation is required.</P>
    <P><B>Ice tongs</B></P>
    <P><B>A measure</B> : Very useful to ensure the correct measurement of
    ingredients goes into the cocktail. It is useful to have two, one being
    twice the size of the other.</P>
    <P><B>Corkscrew</B></P>
    <P><B>A bottle opener</B></P>
    <P><B>A cocktail shaker</B></P>

    tools to make most cocktails.
