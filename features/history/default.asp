<p align="justify">There is great controversy over the actual derivation of the term cocktail. I
don't think any one will ever agree on the actual origin, but there sure are
some interesting stories.</p>
<p align="justify">Betsy, a barmaid in a tavern in Hall's Corners, NY, served Betsy's Bracers.
During the Revolutionary War, American &amp; French soldiers frequented it.
American soldiers stole some male pheasants from the British &amp; a wild party
was had. While drinking they toasted to Betsy's drink &quot;Here's to the divine
liquor which is as delicious to the palate, as the cock's tails are beautiful to
the eye.&quot; To which a French officer replied, &quot;Vive le cocktail!&quot;.
There is reference to a Betsy Flanagan. Who knows which Betsy, was Betsy
Flanagan. One story goes something along the lines of decorating the out side of
a glass with a tail feather from a rooster. Some say that this is where
Washington and his officers frequented. Washington wore feathers in his hat, and
one of his officers toasted to &quot;the cock's tail&quot;. (Well, you wouldn't
really want to drink &quot;macaronis&quot; today, would you?)</p>
<p align="justify">There is another tavern also In NY that claims it was the original. The
tavern keeper used his witty stories, and daughter's beauty to gain favour with
good patrons. The daughter, Peggy mixed a powerful concoction which recipe was
held secret. She was in love with a sailor. Upon his return with a promotion,
and a prized fighting cock, named Lightning, he asked for her hand. In their
honeymoon bed, Lightning crowed, and shook loose a tail feather, which she put
in his concoction that she had made. She said, &quot;Lightning names this drink!
Drink this cocktail, sir, to your success with my father, and as a pledge to our
future happiness!&quot; This was a sign of good fortune &amp; they used the sign
of the tail feather on their tavern emblem for many years to come.</p>
<p align="justify">A drink called &quot;cock's ale&quot; was served in early colonial times
during cock fights. It was a mixture of ale into which a sack of a par-boiled
chicken, raisins, mace and brown sugar was placed. This was left to ferment for
about nine days.</p>
<p align="justify">And yet another colonial story is that the tap for pouring ale was referred
to as a &quot;cock&quot;. Signs would show a cock and a bottle. When the bottom
of the barrel was reached, it was called the &quot;cock tail&quot;. A Colonel
Carter of Virginia was served a poor quality cock tail and proclaimed,
&quot;Hereafter, I will drink cocktails of my own brewing&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify">Some time around 1800, King Axoloti VII of Mexico was meeting with an
American General of the Southern States to discuss a peace treaty. The King
asked the General if he would like a drink &amp; a beautiful girl brought one
cup, adorned in jewels. It was embarrassing for both, as one would have to drink
first. Seeing this, the girl drank it. Her name was Coctel. The General promised
to immortalize her name.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="/cocktails/recipe.asp?ID=94">The Sazerac</a> is also reported to be
the first cocktail. Antoine Amedee Peychaud, born in France and creator of
Peychaud Bitters was it's inventor. Peychaud invented his bitters in Santo
Domingo and brought the recipe to New Orleans with him. He opened a drugstore
called Pharmacie Peychaud on Royal Street. Friends gathered frequently to sample
his drinks served in a coquetier which is the French word for an egg cup. The
mispronunciation of cocquetier resulted in the term cocktail.</p>
<p align="justify">Some say it originated in England. Horses of superb quality, but of mixed
origins would have their tails docked to identify them. They were known as
&quot;cocktails&quot;. A Dr. Johnson, familiar with the term, mixed his friend
Boswell a drink of wine laced with gin. He told him, &quot;to mix spirits to
wine smacks of our alcoholic hyperbole. It would be a veritable cocktail of a
drink.&quot; Another English story points to the officers of the Second Regimen
of the Royal Sussex Fusileers. Other regimens called the officers, who wore
plumes in their caps, &quot;the cocktails&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify">In Mississippi, during the riverboat gambling days, men fought each other and
the winner got to wear a red cock's feather in his cap. He was then known as the
&quot;Cock of the Walk&quot;. They also would drink every spirit in the boat's
lounge in a glass that resembled a breast of a cock, with a stirrer that
resembled a tail feather.</p>
<p align="justify">Who knows, it is as elusive as some of the cocktails names. Everyone claims
to originate them, but who really knows? I tend to think of it like the old
saying, &quot;There is no original thought.&quot;</p>
