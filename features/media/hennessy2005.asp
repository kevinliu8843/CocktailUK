    <td width="100%"><b>Hennessy Fine de Cognac by N.Bertaux</b><br>
	For the holiday season, the artist Nadya Bertaux and Hennessy have joined 
	forces to give the Hennessy Fine de Cognac bottle a completely new gift box. 
	Nadya's work on the box takes its inspiration from a combination of her own 
	work and the development process of the cognac.<br>
	<br>
	<b>The creation</b><br>
	Through her creation Nadya Bertaux evokes the mysterious evaporation of the 
	eaux de vie during the cognac production cycle, which has the poetic name 
	&quot;the angels' share &quot;. This gift box symbolises this mysterious phenomenon, 
	and the series of strips that she makes allow us a glimpse of the warm, 
	amber colours of the cognac.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Hennessy Fine de Cognac</b><br>
	Hennessy Fine de Cognac is a delicate cognac, the fruit of the harmonious 
	blend of some sixty eaux-de-vie from the four premier grape-growing regions 
	of the cognac area. The different eaux-de-vie of which it is composed have 
	aged for between 4 and 10 years in red oak casks that have enriched it with 
	delicate aromas.<br>
	<br>
	Hennessy Fine de Cognac is distinguished by its finesse and its woody notes, 
	in addition to the elegance and purity of its robe with glints of amber. Its 
	very well-balanced nose suggests a promise of softness, with a light, very 
	subtle, oak finish.<br>
	<br>
	On the palate, it reveals aromas evocative of brioche and grilled almonds 
	before opening out into a final bouquet rich in notes of mild, honeyed 
	spices.<br>
	<br>
	The subtlety of Hennessy Fine de Cognac provides the perfect accompaniment 
	to other flavours, bringing out all of their richness. Its uniquely mild 
	flavour is revealed to perfection with certain dishes, most notably foie 
	gras. It also makes an ideal partner for the sweet flavours of tarte tatin, 
	or desserts based on honey or strawberries. Hennessy Fine de Cognac can be 
	enjoyed as an aperitif, with a mixer or in a cocktail, as an after-dinner 
	drink, neat or over ice.<br>
