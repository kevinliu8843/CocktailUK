    <td>Started in 2000, Cocktail : UK's brief was to design a UK specific cocktail based web site to inform and educate the public about cocktail recipes and provide a huge, user contributable database of recipes. 
<P>Since then it has grown significantly, now attracting over 1 million unique visitors a month. We now have hundreds of cocktail based products, a thriving forum and an excellent user base around the UK.</P>
<H5>Special thanks</H5>
<P>Special thanks go to Lee Taylor for his efforts on the forum and other equally excellent work.</P>
