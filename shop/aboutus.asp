<h2>About Drinkstuff</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;">
<P align="left">Drinkstuff.com is proud to be one of the original e-tailers that took advantage of the world wide web way back in 1998, and is still going strong. Drinkstuff was born out of our mother company Barmans Ltd, which has been trading in pub wares nationally since 1977. Designed to help bring pub and bar related items to domestic users, Drinkstuff.com offers an ever increasing variety of products online, currently numbering over 6000. Our warehouse is constantly undergoing improvements with our new mezzanine flooring increasing our storage space to 28,000 sq ft, ready to be filled with new product ranges. Whether you need some branded pint glasses for a birthday present, or you need to kit out your new home bar with various sundries, Drinkstuff.com is your one-stop shop. Even if you are a commercial bar owner, we will happily cater to your needs as we welcome bulk trades orders from all over the country.

<p>With a dedicated buying team that continually sources the latest products at trade shows in the UK and abroad, Drinkstuff.com aims to keep its product range fresh and to keep our prices competitive. New products are added to our website almost daily, to provide our customers with the best choice available.
