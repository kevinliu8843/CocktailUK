To thank you all for your support and to offer future incentives to you we would like to give something back, this is why we have launched this great rewards scheme.<IMG border="0" src="../images/inset_quoteend.gif"></P>
<P>So, you now earn money off future purchases with every order you place over £20.</P>
        <H4>How it works</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>For every £20 you spend in an order with us, you will earn 1 point. </LI>
  <LI>Every point is worth £1 off a future purchase.<BR>
  <BR>
  Example:<BR>
  You spend £80 with us today - You earn 4 points = £4 off a future order. </LI>
</UL>
<P align="center">It's as simple as that!</P>
<P>You can check how many points you have by logging into your account <A target="_blank" href="http://www.drinkstuff.com/member/secure/customer_area.asp">here...</A></P>
<P>Note: Points are non-transferable or exchangeable for cash under any circumstances.<BR>
Reward points can only be collected and used with 'online' purchases.</P>
