<P>Security is one of our top priorities and we guarantee to keep all details you supply us confidential.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike many other companies we do not store your debit or credit card details, in fact we do not even get to see them as the transactional part of purchasing from us is handled by www.securehosting.com.<BR>
<BR>
Please also be aware that we also do not send your card details out with your goods either - avoiding any possible security issues in transit.<BR>
<BR>
When you place an order by our secure server, your credit card details are protected from interception. </P>
<P>Our servers offer 128-bit SSL3 encryption of data transmissions, so your security is assured whenever you place an order. Depending on your browser, you will see a different confirmation that your connection is secure (on our checkout page). 
Generally it will be a small padlock at the bottom of your browser.</P>
